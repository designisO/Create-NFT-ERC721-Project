## Deploy a Simple NFT on Ethereum

In this project I wanted to create a basic NFT project on Ethereum. To do this, I was able to create the smart contract within VSCode. The framework for compiling and deploying the ERC721 Contract is called HardHat. 

## Overview
- Create a ERC721 Contract using Hardhat
- Deploy on Rinkeby Testnet.

### Hardhat
Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. It helps developers manage and automate the recurring tasks that are inherent to the process of building smart contracts and dApps, as well as easily introducing more functionality around this workflow. 

## Rinkeby Testnet
Rinkeby is an Ethereum test network that allows for blockchain development testing before deployment on Mainnet, the main Ethereum network.

## NFT
Non Fungible Token

## ERC721
ERC721 is a standard for representing ownership of non-fungible tokens, that is, where each token is unique. ERC721 is a more complex standard than ERC20, with multiple optional extensions, and is split across a number of contracts.
